I am a Postdoctoral Assistant Professor (Van Loo Postdoc Fellow) in the Department of Mathematics and Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Statistics working with [Prof. Yang Chen](https://yangchenfunstatistics.github.io/yangchen.github.io//) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 

Before that, I got my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Mathematical at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in June, 2023, under the supervision of [Prof. Jian-Feng Cai](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/~jfcai/) and [Prof. Dong Xia](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/~madxia/). I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degrees in Mathematics from Zhejiang University in June, 2019.
